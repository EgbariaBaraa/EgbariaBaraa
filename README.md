- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EgbariaBaraa
-  Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Science at the Technion. (agbariya@campus.technion.ac.il)
-  Iâ€™m maintaining all of my HomeWorks on GitHub, so it will be easier for me to access them in the future.
-  my code can serve as a reference, yet, I strongly condemn any use of the code that does not apply to the Technion regulations.
-  I am not responsible for illegal use of this code, such as copying it.
